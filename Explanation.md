## View 1: 1. Masthead

As a landing page, we need to let the user know what is our product (defined in the Title), a short description of what product or services we offer (defined in the Subtitle), and what action they can do right now (defined in Call-to-action (CTA)).

In the subtitle, we should define the features that solve the problem. In this case, we have an anime discovery with watchlist features. So users can build a binge-watching chain to make the holiday time efficient.

## View 1: 2. Discover Popular Anime
One of the most important reasons for users to come to a website is they want to find something. We make the finding process easier by giving them suggestions, a list of the most popular animes. Every item has its own score, Top 10 tag, and visual image.

The default title is limited to 2 lines, but when the user hovers over the item, the title container will expand to show the whole title, and show the "Add to Watchlist" button.

There is 3 interaction to go to every page on this website, as a navbar purposed to navigate the site.

## View 2: 5&6. Title, Alternative Title, Quantitative Data (statistic), Add to Watchlist, Description, and Background
In this section, I could put a lot more information of the anime. But in regard to very limited of time, I need to choose what information to show. So I decide to show only this information that able to cover these concern:
- information should support user-decision making throughout quantitative and qualitative data
  - Quantitative Data: Statistics -
    Statictics often represent the real users (or watchers) opinion, if it has a good statistic it more likely to be worthed-it.
  - Qualitative Data : Description and Review -
    With the descriptive explanation, user can imagine about the storyline so it may also support the decision making.
